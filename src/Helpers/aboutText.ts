const aboutText = [
  "I'm G, an artist, and programmer dedicated to exploring and disrupting our perceived reality. This website houses my public-facing portfolio, showcasing my works for the past 15 years.",
  "My work blurs the lines between the physical and the digital, distorting bodies and space to explore the human experience from a unique perspective. I utilize various mediums like browser and 3D graphics, sculpture, and installation to challenge perceptions and unveil unseen connections. Through my work, I aim to communicate honestly using our visual language to illustrate narratives that speak to our shared human experiences. I strive to build a universe that mirrors our own yet reverberates with an inherent sense of calm and beauty.",
  "While you won't find a CV here, my work has been exhibited globally in renowned institutions. I believe in the value of the work itself rather than the accolades it receives. For any queries about my exhibition history, feel free to email me.",
