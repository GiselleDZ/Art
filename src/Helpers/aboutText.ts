  "I'm G, an artist, and programmer dedicated to exploring and disrupting our perceived reality.",
  "My work often distorts bodies and space to dissect the human experience. I use multiple mediums, from browser and 3D graphics, to sculpture and installation, to challenge perceptions and unveil unseen connections. Through my work, I aim to communicate openly using our visual language to illustrate narratives that speak to our human experiences. I strive to build worlds that mirror our own, beautiful and flawed."
