  "Giselle Zatonyl is an innovative artist whose work delves into the sensory depths of the human experience, forging connections between our physical ties to other beings, our evolving relationship with the future, and technology. Giselle pushes the boundaries of imagination to ignite conversations about the nature of humanity in our ever-changing world. Drawing inspiration from the ethereal aesthetics of VR and browser graphics, Giselle employs color, texture, and abstraction to challenge perceptions of self and explore the interconnectivity of existence. Their artistic influences include Gego, Sol LeWitt, and Alina Szapocznikow, as well as contemporary visionaries such as Marguerite Humeau, Tisan Tsu, Simone Yvette Leigh, Sara Ludy, and Ivana Basic.",
  "Giselle Zatonyl's distinctive aesthetic features a harmonious fusion of palettes, seamlessly blending dark, cool, muted tones with vibrant neon highlights inspired by nature's nocturnal beauty and bright, light cool tones that evoke the serenity of a daytime atmosphere. These palettes work together to heighten the ethereal and abstract qualities of the artwork, further enriched by minimal, geometric abstraction and the use of textures and colors that reference human and non-human bodily elements. The outcome is a mesmerizing visual experience that invites viewers to explore the deeper layers of meaning and sensations embodied in each piece.",
  "Giselle is dedicated to discovering new ways to engage with viewers, transcending traditional limitations, and fostering dialogues about the human experience, our connections to the surrounding world, and the influence of technology on our evolving identities. Working primarily with browser graphics, 3D animation, and projections on geometric sculptures, Giselle continues to explore the frontiers of artistic mediums to create immersive experiences for their audience. Through this creative journey, Giselle aspires to inspire reflection on our perceptions and sensations, cultivating a profound understanding of our collective existence.",
