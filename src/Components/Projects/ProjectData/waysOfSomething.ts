  description:
    "`Ways of Something`, is a contemporary remake of John Bergerâ€™s BBC documentary, `Ways of Seeing` (1972). Commissioned by The One Minutes, at the Sandberg Instituut in Amsterdam and compiled by Lorna Mills, the first episode consists of one-minute videos by 30 web-based artists who commonly work with 3D rendering, gifs, film remix, webcam performances, and websites to describe the cacophonous conditions of artmaking after the internet. Giselle Zatonyl is minute #22. In 2017, The Whitney Museum of American Art acquired Ways of Something for their permanent collection.",
